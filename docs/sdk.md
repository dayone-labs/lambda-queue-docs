# SDK Libraries

Here you can find a list LambdaQueue SDK libraries that will make your integration
much faster. If your language is not listed, you can always check [API Reference](/docs/api)
and integrate using our REST API.

- [Next.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dayone-labs/lambda-queue-serverless) - This will make your Next.js integration a piece of cake. Check [here](/examples/next) for an example on how to integrate it.
- [Express/Connect](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dayone-labs/lambda-queue-connect) - Library for Express/Connect middleware frameworks. Check [here](/examples/express) for a basic example.
- [TypeScript/JavaScript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dayone-labs/lambda-queue-js) - For any other uses we have a base JavaScript/TypeScript SDK. It's a bit more involved, but should get you up and running in minutes.
